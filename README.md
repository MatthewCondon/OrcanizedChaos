# Orcanized Chaos
By 3/c Matthew Condon and 2/c Sontino Allentuck

This repository is dedicated to Orca-nized Chaos, a semester-long project for Software Engineering. The overall goal of this specific project is to create an online arcade web application dedicated to the ongoing feud between Orcas and Yachts. This online arcade features, at the moment, two games: Asteroids and Space Inavders. 

Key components of this web application include a login system, games and leaderboards, and a feedback form.
